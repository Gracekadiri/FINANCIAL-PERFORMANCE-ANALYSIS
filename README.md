# FINANCIAL-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS
## Introduction
This project highlights the outcomes of a thorough financial performance analysis, with a central focus on the importance of data visualization in enhancing businesses' decision-making processes. 
I have compiled the findings into a concise two-page Excel sheet, which features interactive charts, graphs, and tables, all conveniently hyperlinked for effortless navigation.
## Data Source
The financial data used in this analysis is derived from a fictional company's income records for the entire fiscal year. 
It is important to note that this data is purely for demonstration purposes and not representative of any real-world entity.
## Excel Techniques
I used various tools and functions to perform the analysis. 
- **Pivot tables** were employed to summarize and aggregate the income data efficiently. 
- **Conditional formatting** helped identify variations and trends in income percentages 
- **Data validation** ensured the accuracy of inputs. 
- **Charts and graphs**, such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, were created to visualize the income distribution and marketing strategy breakdown. 
- **VLOOKUP** was used to retrieve data from different tables, 
- **IF function** enabled conditional calculations to make informed business decisions based on specific criteria.
